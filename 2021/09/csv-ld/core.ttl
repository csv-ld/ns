and if this row is not the first row, then the subject of the previous row is assumed.
If not in the form of a URL or CURIE (using a registered #prefix),
then the cell value is interpreted to be a variable so as to unify with its usages in
other cells in the changesheet -- an identifier is generated to substitute for the variable.

An identified or literal value for the object/value part of the statement.
If left blank and if next row's subject cell is also blank, then an identifier
is generated for both. If the value is the same as that of a variable introduced
earlier in the current sheet for a statement's subject, then the value is interpreted
as an instance of that variable, rather than as a literal string value with the same sequence
of characters.
